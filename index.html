          <p><span class="welcome">Hello, and welcome!</span> I am a dabbler, curiosity enthusiast, and firm believer that the second law of thermodynamics can be applied to every area of our lives. I am a city dweller but a nature and animal lover. My spirit animal is a hippo <em>(hence the drawing of the hippo I have done).</em> I love to problem solve and create well functioning, beautiful design. I value ideas, communication, and collaboration.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Backgound</h4>
          <p>I am from good old Spokane Washington (if you haven’t been there, you are not missing much ;) ). I have lived in Portland for the last 8 years and I can’t imagine ever calling another place “home”.</p>
          <p>The majority of my work background has been in hospitality. I have worked in hotels doing front desk, concierge, accounting/payroll, admin work and HR roles. I have worked in real estate for a short time as well as support/development for a tech company out in Lake O. I am excited for what opportunities Epicodus will open for me. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>Way back in 2008 I graduated with an AAS in Web Design (when Flash was still a big thing). Since then, I have gone back to get my Bachelors in Psychology. In the very far off future I may want to go back to school to get my Master in Counseling, but again far, far, off future.</p>
          <p>I have been learning a little coding on my own but decided to attend Epicodus so I could get to where I want to go with coding faster.... Wherever that may be. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Interests/Hobbies</h4>
          <p>I love to travel anywhere I can and learn new things about different cultures. I try to go somewhere new at least once a year even if it is to a new spot I haven’t been on the Oregon coast. Last year I got to visit Alaska which was a beautiful, fun trip.</p>
          <p>I love my animals and am a soon to be Corgi mom of a pup named Spock. Once he comes I am sure my “free” time will be taken up with running after him and taking him to the dog park. </p>
          <p>I would like to say playing the piano is a hobby of mine, but playing the piano is more an interest at this time. Maybe when/if I ever have more time it will become a hobby instead of interest. </p>
