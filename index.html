          <h4>Backgound</h4>
          <p>I am a dabbler, curiosity enthusiast, and firm believer that the second law of thermodynamics can be applied to every area of our lives. I am a city dweller but a nature and animal lover. My spirit animal is a hippo. I love to problem solve and create well functioning, beautiful design. I value ideas, communication, and collaboration. I like taking an idea at it’s infancy and developing it to it’s full potential. I believe we can also live this concept in life by change, development, and growth as individuals and as a community. I have lived the majority of my life in the beautiful PNW but am always on the look out for new places to go and explore.</p>
